Notes -

Consider the manual time taken by inducing tech processes. Aim is to keep manual time required minimal. (It should certainly be lower than its now)

At what point in the sales process are white slips created ?

Can we directly connect printer data to app ? (Or even correlating / checking with application's data - this is a biz requirement)

does the printer give pages used since startup, or for a given time-period.
